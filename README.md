# sketchpad

This is an Odin project exercise to create a web-based app which mimics an Etch-a-Sketch or a Sketch Pad.

It uses a grid of multiple divs, with the colour of the divs changing upon hover. 

The main challenge with this project was dealing with the re-sizing of the grid, ensuring it remained a square and that things like the event listeners weren't lost in the process.

I intend to improve the styling in the future.
